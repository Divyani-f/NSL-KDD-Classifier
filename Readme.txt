All of the data that is used in project is included in the folder itself: 
To run the both of the notebook , just change the path variable to your local machine path.
The notebook will run in the Jupyter notebook compatible program.

I have build models on two different dataset , NSL- KDD and UNR -IDD 
NSL- KDD based model is in file "Main_NSL_KDDClassifier" and UNR -IDD in the "UNR Classifier" file.
The main notebook file is Main_NSL_KDDClassifier  , where I have most of the experimentation with different types of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.
For Machine Learning models I have used decision tree , Gausian NB and OnevsRest classifier, and for Deep Learning I have used LSTM based model.
For 2nd UNR -IDD based model ,I used decision tree classifier since it works the best and gives the best accuracy.
All of the scores , accuracy for ML models are shown in the notebook file and result graph for neural network is shown.
